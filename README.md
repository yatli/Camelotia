# MegaCom.UI

MegaCom host software for communicating with MegaCommandLive(https://github.com/jmamma/MIDICtrl20_MegaCommand)
Features:

- File server for accessing SD card content
- Two-way midi bridge
- Screen mirroring
- You name it

I mainly test on Windows 10 but the software framework is cross platform.
