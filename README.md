## Features:

- File server for accessing SD card content
- Two-way midi bridge
- Screen mirroring
- You name it

## Getting started:

I mainly test on Windows 10 but the software framework is cross platform.
Ping me if you would like a OSX or Linux build.
You'll also need a development version (sysex_file branch) of MCL firmware.
